[Analysis]
- Data Model: Uses `users` collection (referrerWallet) and `user_investments` (sales).
- Logic: `src/lib/orgChart.ts` implements `buildOrgTree` which fetches all users, builds the hierarchy, and aggregates sales (Personal + Team).
- UI: `src/components/OrgChart.tsx` uses `react-d3-tree` to visualize this hierarchy.

[Changes Applied]
1.  **Enhanced UI**: Updated `OrgChart.tsx` to use a modern card-based design for nodes (via `foreignObject`).
    -   Displays Wallet (truncated), Personal Sales, Team Volume, Direct Referrals count.
    -   Color-coded nodes (Root vs Team Lead vs Member).
2.  **Added Controls**: Added Zoom In/Out, Center, and Refresh buttons to the chart.
3.  **Added Summary**: Added a summary header showing "Total Members" and "Total Volume" at the top of the chart card.
4.  **Route Verification**: Confirmed `/admin/organization` exists and is linked in the sidebar.

[Verification]
-   The code correctly aggregates sales recursively.
-   The UI now provides a clear visual representation of the entire organization.
-   The "Total Volume" stat aggregates the `teamSales` of all root nodes, representing the entire platform's volume (if all users are connected to roots).

The feature is fully implemented and accessible at `/admin/organization`.
